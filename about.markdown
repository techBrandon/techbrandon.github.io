# ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm techBrandon!

Welcome to my blog. I'm a cybersecurity professional who specializes in identity security. I spend most of my time performing security assessments for organizations of all shapes and sizes. Solving unique and complex problems is my passion. I love learning new things and want to share what I know.

This blog is where I write original content and share things I've done both personally and professionally. Whether it's lengthy technical deep-dives, quick tips, or random thoughts, I try to keep things honest, helpful, and fun.

## ðŸ§° Skills & Tools
- Active Directory
- Entra ID
- PowerShell
- Currently exploring: Markdown & Jekyll (obviously!)

## ðŸ“¬ Let's Connect!
Want to say hi or collaborate? You can reach me at pretty much any social @techBrandon, or check out more of my project's on [GitHub](https://github.com/techBrandon).

Thanks for stopping by. Glad you're here.
